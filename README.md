# 1. Getting started 
This project is about recoding a raycasting algorithm, the same one used in older games like Doom or Wolfenstein 3D.<br/><br/>

This algorithm allows to simulate 3d in a 2d environment by sending out rays from the player's position and drawing a vertical line for each when they hit a wall.<br/><br/>

The length of the drawn line will depend on how far the wall hit is.<br/><br/>

You can find another version of this project on my website, programmed in Typescript with the help of canvases.

## 1.1 Features
* Movement : `z`, `q`, `s`, `d` keys.
* Rotation : `left`, `right` arrows.
* Sprite drawing : in the sprites folder, any `.xpm` file will be drawn depending on map configuration.
* Map configuration : more info in the subject.
* Basic minimap.

## 1.2 Installation 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lpellier/cub3d.git && cd cub3d
# Generate the default executable
$ make
# Generate the bonus executable -> minimap and sprite handling
$ make bonus 
```

# 2. Usage
You're free to configure your own map, following the syntax given in the subject.

A few maps are already made available for testing.
```bash
# Available map : maps/shortmap_1sprt.cub
$ ./cub3d <path_to_map>
# Available map : maps/shortmap_3sprt.cub
$ ./cub3d_bonus <path_to_map>
```
